### What I learned

Many of the hurdles I encountered in the process of building this project were simply a product of not yet being fully familiar with the syntax of HTML or CSS. Some (slightly embarassing) examples: I briefly got hung up linking the Google Font to my HTML file because I did not add the "https://" prefix to the hyperlink, I used the "href" attribute instead of "src" in my img tag because I was mistakenly emulating the structure of the link tag, etc. Luckily, these issues are relatively easy to amend with practice.

In contrast, I need to do far more active studying on layout design in CSS. The nuances of margins, padding, and flexbox are many, and I know my code is lacking in efficiency in these areas. Consequently, I'm self-conscious about certain aspects of my page design here: the QR code image isn't evenly padded with white space on the top vs. the sides, I'm not sure if the figure element is necessary, there are presumably some redundancies in the way I set my margins, etc. I'm eager to see how others have gotten the same or better results with cleaner and simpler code.

I also assume there are many issues with my code that I am not yet fully aware of, which is why I am submitting my project in what is no doubt a less-than-ideal state: so I can see others' solutions to the same challenge. Another area I'm self-conscious about is accessibility; I know that making websites means going through far more steps than it appears to ensure every element is accessible, so while my page may look okay on the surface, I'm sure I'm missing some crucial information to assist screen-readers, etc. Looking at other solutions will help me understand the specifics of my shortcomings with regards to accessibility.

### Continued development

My goals for the future based on this project are to continue internalizing the basic syntax of HTML and CSS, gain a more thorough understanding of flexbox, and become more efficient in how I style pages generally.
